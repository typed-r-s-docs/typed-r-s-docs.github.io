Launcher
========

- The launcher requires `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ version 3.12 or higher and a `Git <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_ client to be installed.

- In addition to template projects, you can install various demo versions in the launcher. Their number will constantly increase as we aim for long-term support of the launcher and its expanding functionality.

- Please download all projects into one folder. The folder should be named after the working project, as it will contain a ``projects`` folder with projects for Keil and EEZ Studio.
